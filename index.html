    <h1>The Art of the Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin.</p>
    <p>The croissant's journey began with the Austrian Kipferl, but it was perfected in the heart of Paris. Through a meticulous process called lamination, hundreds of thin layers of butter are folded into the dough, resulting in a pastry that is irresistibly crisp on the outside and airy on the inside.</p>
